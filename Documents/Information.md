# Genome Wide Association Studies, mutation intolerance and Copy Number Variants


## Description

This project aims to investigate constraints to CNV variation by
considering at the frequency of CNVs within genes that are thought to be
under strong and weaker selective pressures. Resources such as
phenoscanner (<http://www.phenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac.uk/phenoscanner>)
are cataloging the range of genotype phenotype associations on the human
genome. Databases of exonic CNV variation in large numbers of
individuals are available, for example ExAC
<http://exac.broadinstitute.org/>), as are attempts to measure how
tolerant genes are to mutations (<http://genic-intolerance.org>). We can
hypothesise that genes that are intolerant to mutation are also
intolerant to gene losses and duplications. This bioinformatic project
aims to integrate gene specific information about phenotype, gene
intolerance and CNV population frequency.

## Databases

Note that the browser may not be the most appropriate way for us to
access these data. Downloading the data and working on
statistics/spreadsheet software could be better.

GWAS Catalog: [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/)

*A resource for associations between SNPs and disease/phenotype. Others
are available, for example Grasp: 
[https://grasp.nhlbi.nih.gov/Overview.aspx](https://grasp.nhlbi.nih.gov/Overview.aspx)*

ExAc: <http://exac.broadinstitute.org/>

* Has information on CNV counts and intolerance scores for CNVs*

1000 genomes: <http://www.internationalgenome.org/>

*    Human genetic variation, both structural and at single sites.*

dbVar: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar>

* A database of human structural genetic variation*

A couple more papers that might be useful

http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003709

*	Talks about intolerance scores*

https://academic.oup.com/mbe/advance-article/doi/10.1093/molbev/msx305/4675175

*	Very interesting paper that shows how a GWAS database can be used to inform hypotheses about the evolutionary genetics of cancer.*
