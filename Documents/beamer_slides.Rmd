Questions
=========

* Are the variants in CNVs and SNPs in the same genes?
* What are the limits to CNV variation?
* Is there a systematic difference between CNVs associated with Height and schizophrenia?


Helpful Data
=============

* ExAc
    * Has derived gene centric intolerance scores for CNVs (completely untested)
    * Based on all variants and those found singly

* GWAS Catalog

* More GWAS summary data

### Additonal Question:
    
Are the CNV intolerance scores from ExaC useful?

A Paper
=======

The genetic overlap between schizophrenia and height

Schizophr Res. 2013 Dec; 151(0): 226–228.

Epidemiological studies suggest that height and schizophrenia risk are inversely correlated. These findings might arise because i) height and schizophrenia share genetic variants and ii) the effects of these shared variants are in opposite direction for the two traits. We use genome wide association data to empirically evaluate these hypotheses. We find that variants which impact on height and risk for schizophrenia \textcolor{blue}{are distributed across several genomic regions and the directions of effect vary, some consistent and others inconsistent with the direction expected from the phenotypic data}. Moreover, signals that were in and not in accord with the phenotypic data aggregated in distinct biological pathways.

Keywords:  \textcolor{red}{Suggestive Signals}, \textcolor{red}{Shrinkage}
